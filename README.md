# memrag
This is the journey of me learning how to code with Go. Hopefully also a good memory rag package!

How to use this package:
Given a sentence or paragraph -> memrag -> Context that might be related to the topic.


Memory: Just like how people get to know each other, the goal is to simulate how human memorize, which in theory is just another complex neural network.
How do we do that: 1. Read a bunch of memory related stuff 2. Go down the rabbit hole of building a memory model 3. Figure out what the my training data is 4. Figure out how memory should be structured
